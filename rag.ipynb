      "Module 2–Social Network Structure , Measures &Visualization5ØNetwork Analysis is a method for finding patterns under the structure of the network. ØIt relies on graph theory. ØThe network consists of nodes that represent individuals, people, or things, and edges represent the connection or relationship between nodes. ØSocial Network Analysis (SNA) is interested in relationships among social entities such as individuals or organizations.\n",

      "Module 2–Social Network Structure,Measures &Visualization6ØNodes(Actors) and edges(Relation Tie) have different meanings in different networks. ØFor example, for a bank, the nodes represent bank accounts, while the edges represent the transaction between these accounts. ØFor social media applications such as Facebook and Twitter, nodes represent individuals, while edges represent there is a connection between these people.ØNodes and edges create a graph together and edges may have direction.       If the way of the relationship between nodes is insignificant then edges have no  direction and the graph becomes undirected.ØIn the social media application example, if the edge exists between two nodes (or in other words two people), it means that they are both friends of each other.Basics of Social network Structure\n",
      "Module 2–Social Network Structure , Measures &Visualization7ØTherefore this relationship is undirected.Ø In the bank example, the relationship is directed because transaction happens from one account to another. ØTherefore, we design our network with directed graphs.\n",
      "Basics of Social network Structure\n",

Hence, the graph can be traversed in either direction. The absence of an arrow tells us that the graph is undirected.ØIn the example on the left, the graph can be traversed from nodeAtoBas well as from nodeBtoA.\n",

      "Module 2–Social Network Structure , Measures &Visualization9Some more complex directed and undirected graphs might look like the following:\n",
      "Basics of Social network Structure\n",
      "Module 2–Social Network Structure , Measures &Visualization10•Edge DirectionØThere are two types of edges: directed and undirected. ØIt will be necessary to decipher what type of edge your data contains when building a network graph.ØDirected edges are applied from one node to another with a starting node and an ending node.ØFor example, when a twitter user tags another twitter user in a tweet, that relationship is directed. ØThe user who wrote the tweet (starting node) applied that relationship to the user who they tagged (ending node). ØThe tagged user has not necessarily reciprocated that relationship. Ø Another example of a directed edge are payments. ØIf a customer (starting node) pays a coffee shop (ending node) for a coffee, that relationship is not necessarily reciprocated because the coffee shop has not also paid the customer.\n",
      "Basics of Social network Structure\n",
      "Module 2–Social Network Structure , Measures &Visualization11•Edge WeightØAn Edge’s weight is the number of times that edge appears between two specific nodes.Ø In many applications, each edge of a graph has an associated numerical value, called a weight.ØUsually, the edge weights are non- negative integers. ØWeighted graphs may be either directed or undirected. The weight of an edge is often referred to as the \"cost\" of the edge.ØFor example, if Person A buys a coffee from a coffee shop 3 times, the edge connecting Person A and the coffee shop will have a weight of 3. ØHowever, if Person B only buys coffee from the coffee shop once, the edge connecting Person B and the coffee shop will have a weight of 1.\n",
      "Basics of Social network Structure\n",
      "Module 2–Social Network Structure , Measures &Visualization12ØHowever, in a directed network, there are actually three different degree measures. ØBecause these edges have a starting and end node, the in-degree (number of edges the node is an end node of), out-degree(number of edges a node is a starting node of), and degree (number of edges a node is either a starting node or end node of) can be calculated.\n",

      "Module 2–Social Network Structure , Measures &Visualization13•Centrality MeasuresØCentrality is one of the core principles of network analysis. It measures how “central” a node is in the network. This is used as an estimate of its importance in the network.ØCentrality is a collection of metrics used to quantify how important and influential a specific node is to the network as a whole. ØIt is important to remember that centrality measures are used on specific nodes within the network, and do not provide information on a network level. ØCorrespondingly, there are a number of ways to measure centrality of a node. In this chapter, four types of centrality are considered: Ødegree centrality, Øcloseness centrality, Øbetweenness centrality, and Øeigenvector centralityBasics of Social network Structure\n",

      "Basics of Social network Structure\n",
      "Module 2–Social Network Structure , Measures &Visualization15•Degree CentralityØA node’s degree is the number of edges the node has. ØIn an undirected network, there is only one measure for degree.Ø For example, if node A has edges connecting it to Node B and Node D, then node A’s degree is 2.ØIn Figure node P has the highest degree centrality of 9. ØMeanwhile, node F has a relatively low degree centrality of 5. Many other nodes have that same centrality value or higher (e.g., node D has a degree centrality of 5)ØDegree centrality is a good measure of the total connections a node has, but will not necessarily indicate the importance of a node in connecting others or how central it is to the main group.ØDegree centrality is a good measure of the total connections a node has, but will not necessarily indicate the importance of a node in connecting others \n",
      "Basics of Social network Structure\n",
      "Module 2–Social Network Structure , Measures &Visualization16•ClosenessØCloseness measures how well connected a node is to every other node in the network. ØA node’s closeness is the average number of hops required to reach every other node in the network. ØA hop is the path of an edge from one node to another ØFor example, as seen in the diagram below, Node A is connected to Node B, and Node B is connected to Node C. ØFor Node A to reach Node C it would take two hops.ØCloseness centrality indicates how close a node is to all other nodes in the network.Ø It is calculated as the average of the shortest path length from the node to every other node in the network\n",
      "Basics of Social network Structure\n",
      "Module 2–Social Network Structure , Measures &Visualization17ØLet’s start by computing the average shortest path length of node D. ØTable  shows each node and the length of the shortest path from D. ØThe average of those shortest path lengths is: 1:71: ØNote that we divide by 7 because there are seven other nodes. ØNow repeat this for node A. This is shown in Here, the average shortest path length is:\n",
      "Basics of Social network Structure\n",
      "Module 2–Social Network Structure , Measures &Visualization18ØIn the case of closeness centrality, or average shortest path length, lower values indicate more central nodes. ØThus, since node D’s closeness centrality is 1.71 and node A’s is 3.43, node D is more central by this measure. ØThe benefits of closeness centrality are that it indicates nodes as more central if they are closer to most of the nodes in the graph.\n",
      "Basics of Social network Structure\n",
      "Module 2–Social Network Structure , Measures &Visualization19ØBetweenness centrality measures how important a node is to the shortest paths through the network. ØTo compute betweenness for a node N, we select a pair of nodes and find all the shortest paths between those nodes.ØFor example, consider previous figureLet’s compute betweenness centrality for node B. ØThere are 10 pairs of nodes to consider: AC, AD, AE, AF, CD, CE, CF, DE, DF, and EF. Without counting, we know that 100% of the shortest paths from A to every other node in the network go through B, since A can’t reach the rest of the network without B. ØThus, the fractions for AC, AD, AE, and AF are all 1. From C to D, there are two shortest paths: one through B and one through E. ØThus, 1 ÷2 = 0.5 go through B. The same is true for the shortest path from D to C. For the remaining pairs CE, CF, DE, DF, and EF no shortest paths go through B.Ø Thus, the fraction for all of these is zero. Now we can calculate the betweenness for B:\n",
      "ØIn contrast, the betweenness centrality of A is zero, since no shortest paths between D, C, D, E, and F go through A. ØBetweenness centrality is one of the most frequently used centrality measures. It captures how important a node is in the flow of information from one part of the network to another.Basics of Social network Structure\n",
      "Module 2–Social Network Structure , Measures &Visualization20•Eigenvector centrality : measures a node’s importance while giving consideration to the importance of its neighborsØFor example, a node with 300 relatively unpopular friends on Facebook would have lower eigenvector centrality than someone with 300 very popular friends (like Barak Obama). It is sometimes used to measure a node’s influence in the network. ØIt is determined by performing a matrix calculation to determine what is called the principal eigenvector using the adjacency matrix.ØImp note:Degree— the amount of neighbors of the nodeEigenVector / PageRank— iterative circles of neighborsCloseness— the level of closeness to all of the nodesBetweenness— the amount of short path going through the nodeØhttps://towardsdatascience.com/social-network-analysis-from-theory-to-applications-with-python-d12e9a34c2c7Basics of Social network Structure\n",
      "Module 2–Social Network Structure , Measures &Visualization21•Describing networks ØA number of measures can be used to describe the structure of a network as a whole. density is one of these. ØDensity the number of edges in the graph divided by the number of possible edges is one of the most common ways of describing a network. ØHowever, other statistics provide different insights into network structure..ØTo create a degree distribution, calculate the degree for each node in the network. Table 3.3 shows the degrees for each node in the graph shown in Figure 3.1. The next step is to count how many nodes have each degree. This is totaled for each degree, including those for which there are no nodes with that count. Table 3.4 shows the node count for each degree in this network. The most common way to show a degree distribution is in a bar graph. The x-axis has the degrees in ascending order, and the Y-axis indicates how many nodes have a given-degree. For the data in Table 3.4, we would make a bar graph as shown in Figure 3.5\n",

This guide will cover size and density.•Network SizeØNetwork size is the number of nodes in the network. ØThe size of a network does not take into consideration the number of edges. ØFor example, a network with nodes A, B, and C has a size of 3.\n",
      "Basics of Social network Structure\n",
      "Module 2–Social Network Structure , Measures &Visualization23•Network DensityØNetwork density is the number of edges divided by the total possible edges. ØFor example, a network with Node A connected to Node B, and Node B connected to Node C, the network density is 2/3 because there are two edges out of a possible 3.\n",
      "Basics of Social network Structure\n",
      "Module 2–Social Network Structure , Measures &Visualization24•Path-Level MeasuresØPath-level measures provide information for a path between one node and another node. ØPaths follow edges between nodes, known as hops. There are also many different path-level measures, but this article will cover length and distance.•LengthØLength is the number of edges between the starting and ending nodes, known as hops.Ø In order to calculate the length between two nodes, a path must be predetermined.•DistanceØDistance is the number of edges or hops between the starting and ending nodes following the shortest path. ØUnlike length, the distance between two nodes uses only the shortest path — the path that requires the least hops.Basics of Social network Structure\n",
      "Module 2–Social Network Structure , Measures &Visualization25•Connected Components and BridgesØNot all nodes in a network will necessarily be connected to each other. ØA connected component is a group of nodes that are connected to each other, but not connected to another group of nodes.Ø Another way of thinking of this is a group of connected nodes that have no path to a node from another group. ØDepending on the network, there can be many connected components, or even only one. The below diagram shows a network with two connected components.\n",

      "Module 2–Social Network Structure , Measures &Visualization26ØThesizeof the network is defined as the number of nodes or edges. ØThedensityof the network is calculated as the total number of existing edges divided by the number of all possible edges. It takes a value between 0 and 1. ØThedegreeof a node represents the number of edges connected to that node. If the edges have direction in the network, then each node hasin-degreeandout-degreevalues. ØIn-degree represents the incoming edges to the node while out-degree represents the outgoing edges from the node.

Such interactions may be in any conventional or non-conventional form, whether they be face-to-face interactions, telecommunication interactions, email interactions or postal mail interactions.•The social analysis networks has also been modeled in the field of cognitive science, where the cognitive aspects of such interactions are utilized for analytical purposes.•Much early research in network analysis is found in educational psychology, and studies of child development.  Network analysis also developed in fields such as sociology and anthropology.

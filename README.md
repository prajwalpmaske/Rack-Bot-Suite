# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Explained

Welcome to the technical documentation of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. RAG combines the power of large language models with retrieval mechanisms to enhance the generation of text, making it particularly effective for applications like question answering, document summarization, and more. This README aims to provide a clear understanding of how RAG operates technically.

## Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid approach that marries the generative capabilities of transformer-based models with the information retrieval (IR) prowess of document databases. By fetching relevant context before generating responses, RAG models can produce more accurate, informed, and contextually rich text.

## How RAG Works

### Step 1: Query Processing

- **Input**: The model receives a query or prompt that needs an informative response.
- **Processing**: The query is encoded using a transformer-based encoder.

### Step 2: Document Retrieval

- **Retrieval**: The encoded query is used to search a document database or knowledge base to find relevant documents. This is often accomplished via vector similarity search.
- **Selection**: The top-N most relevant documents are selected for the next phase.

### Step 3: Context Integration and Response Generation

- **Context Integration**: The selected documents are concatenated with the original query to serve as extended context.
- **Generation**: A generative model, such as GPT or another transformer-based model, uses this enriched context to generate a response.

## Architecture

Our chatbot's architecture is designed to effectively process queries, retrieve relevant information, and generate responses that are both accurate and engaging. The key components of our architecture include:

- **Encoder**: Utilizes `langchain` and its underlying NLP capabilities to encode the query into a high-dimensional vector, capturing the essence of the user's request.

- **Retrieved Documents**: Leverages `chromadb`, a vector database optimized for storing and querying embeddings. It facilitates the rapid retrieval of documents based on semantic similarity to the query vector, ensuring that the most relevant information is used in generating responses.

- **Decoder**: Built on top of generative models from `google.generativeai`, this component synthesizes the information from retrieved documents with the original query. It ensures the final response is both informative and contextually aligned with the user's intent.

## Implementation

The implementation of our RAG chatbot involves several key libraries and frameworks to ensure high performance and scalability:

## Dependencies

Our project relies on several key libraries and frameworks to function correctly. Below is a breakdown of each dependency and its role in our chatbot's development:

### PyPDF2

- **Usage**: Allows our chatbot to read and extract text from PDF files. This is crucial for processing and incorporating information contained in PDF documents into the chatbot's knowledge base.

### langchain

- **Usage**: Provides tools and utilities for building and managing language models. Langchain is instrumental in integrating our chatbot with various NLP and language generation functionalities.

### python-dotenv

- **Usage**: Manages environment variables. It enables our project to securely store and access configuration settings without hard-coding them into the source code.

### pandas

- **Usage**: Offers data manipulation and analysis capabilities. With pandas, we can efficiently organize and preprocess the data that feeds into our chatbot's knowledge base.

### chromadb

- **Usage**: A vector database optimized for storing and querying embeddings. ChromaDB facilitates the rapid retrieval of relevant documents based on semantic similarity, enhancing our chatbot's ability to find pertinent information.

### google-api-python-client and google.generativeai

- **Usage**: These libraries allow us to interact with Google's Generative AI and other APIs, enabling our chatbot to leverage state-of-the-art generative models for creating responses.

### tqdm

- **Usage**: Provides a progress bar for our data processing and training scripts, improving the user experience during long-running operations.

### IPython.display.Markdown

- **Usage**: Enables the rendering of Markdown within Jupyter notebooks. This is particularly useful for documentation and presenting the chatbot's output in a more readable format.

## Installation

You can easily install all required dependencies with the following pip command:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2 langchain python-dotenv pandas chromadb google-api-python-client tqdm ipython
```
